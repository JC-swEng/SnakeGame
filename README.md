# SnakeGame
Classic snake game using Javascript and HTML
Followed Developer Mozilla tutorial (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript/Mouse_controls) to create pong game first, and then altered code to create my version of the classic Snake Game. 
Head of the snake is purple, body is blue. Food is green. Header details length of snake including head, and "speed" level. Every 5 body parts collected, the speed increases.
